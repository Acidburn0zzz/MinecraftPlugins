# Ullarahs Minecraft Plugins
All the plugins. In one place. Such lazy.

Easy.

 * Clone the repo
 * Run 'mvn'
   * This will automatically install the shared lib
   * Will also create shaded jars in a jar directory
 * Do whatever you want with the jars
 * Pat yourself on the back
 
Don't come complaining to me if things aren't working.
